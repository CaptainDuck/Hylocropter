# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with
code in this repository.

## Project

**Hylocropter** — UAV-based multispectral imaging for plant-stress detection in
dragon fruit (*Hylocereus* spp.) farms. Raspberry Pi 4 + Pi NoIR Camera v2 +
Rosco #2007 ("Storaro Blue") gel, carried by an F450 quadcopter with a Pixhawk,
flying autonomous Mission Planner missions over a farm in Tanauan City, Batangas.
Everything runs offline on the Pi, which serves the dashboard from its own Wi-Fi
hotspot.

Group 8 · De La Salle Lipa · CpE Design and Practice 1. The course brief is in
`Requirements.md`; the thesis is a *proposal* (Chapters 1–2 only, no results), so
several things the code needs are unspecified — those are catalogued in
`RESEARCH-GAPS.md`, which is the first place to look when a number seems
arbitrary.

All runnable code lives in `hylocropter/`. The repo root holds prose docs and
`ndvi_capture.old.py` — the archived original, **reference only — do not run**;
see "Hardware-specific physics" below for why.

## Commands

**Working directory is irrelevant** — both entry points derive their paths from
`Path(__file__).parent`, so `python hylocropter/app.py` from the repo root and
`cd hylocropter && python app.py` behave identically, and data always lands in
`hylocropter/hylocropter_data/`. Keep it that way: a cwd-relative default here
means a stray untracked data folder wherever the user happened to be standing.

```bash
pip install -r hylocropter/requirements.txt

# One-off CLI capture. Outputs to hylocropter/hylocropter_data/ground/.
python hylocropter/bndvi.py
python hylocropter/bndvi.py --dev                  # synthetic frame, no camera
python hylocropter/bndvi.py --dev --scene soil     # healthy|mixed|stressed|soil
python hylocropter/bndvi.py --correct-nir --k 0.35 # opt-in leakage correction
python hylocropter/bndvi.py --save-array           # float32 BNDVI as .npz
python hylocropter/bndvi.py --raw                  # also save the Bayer frame as DNG
python hylocropter/bndvi.py -o /some/where         # override the output dir

# Dashboard
python hylocropter/app.py                            # localhost
python hylocropter/app.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000 # expose on the LAN (the Pi)
python hylocropter/app.py --dev                      # synthetic frames (laptop)
python hylocropter/app.py --debug                    # Flask reloader on
```

```bash
pip install -r hylocropter/requirements-dev.txt
pytest                            # 195 tests, from the repo root or anywhere
pytest hylocropter/tests/test_index.py -v
```

**Tests** live in `hylocropter/tests/` and run under **pytest** (config in
`pytest.ini` at the repo root). There is no linter and **no build step**.

- `test_index.py` — the plant-health maths. The channel mapping, the bands, the
  leak correction, the white-reference solve, the rig diagnostics, and a check
  that `colormap.js` still matches `BNDVI_COLOR_STOPS`.
- `test_mapping.py` — photo → footprint → bounds → grid → mission plan, plus the
  survey-block rectangles. Pins the two invariants that keep the map honest (empty
  cells stay `null`, row 0 is the northern edge) and the two that keep a plan
  sensible (corners sort whichever way they were clicked, lines run along the
  longer axis).
- `test_store.py` — the JSON indexes, concurrent writes, legacy migration,
  settings clamping, and the survey blocks: validation, de-duplication, and
  migrating the old single square into one.
- `test_routes.py` — every page renders with no camera and no drone. Imports
  `app.py`, so it sets `HYLOCROPTER_DATA` to a scratch directory first; **never
  point that at real data.**

`.github/workflows/verify.yml` runs all of it in **one job**, plus four things
pytest can't check: `bndvi.py` running in a venv with Flask absent, the working
directory staying irrelevant, the app booting via `__main__`, and greps for a CDN
reference or a reintroduced `(B - R)/(B + R)`.

What CI **cannot** prove: the camera path and the MAVLink path. Those need a bench
run — see `DEPLOYMENT.md` and `RESEARCH-GAPS.md` §7. UI behaviour is still checked
by hand with Playwright (described at the end of `DEPLOYMENT.md`).

## Hardware-specific physics (do NOT get this wrong)

The Rosco #2007 blue filter **passes blue + NIR and blocks red/green**. Behind
the NoIR sensor (no IR-cut filter) the Bayer channels then map to:

| Channel        | What it actually captures             |
|----------------|---------------------------------------|
| Red Bayer (0)  | NIR (red light is blocked by the gel) |
| Green Bayer(1) | Mostly blocked (8–18% transmission) — unused |
| Blue Bayer (2) | Visible blue + some NIR contamination |

So `BNDVI = (NIR − Blue) / (NIR + Blue) = (R − B) / (R + B)`. Healthy plants
reflect lots of NIR, which lands in the **red** channel — a raw capture of
vegetation should look **pinkish/magenta**, not bluish.

The archived `ndvi_capture.old.py` at the repo root has this mapping **reversed**
(treats Blue=NIR, Red=visible). It is kept as a historical artefact for the
writeup only — **do not run it, do not copy its logic into new code**. If you
ever see `(B - R)/(B + R)` outside that archived file, the old bug is being
reintroduced — fix it.

### NIR-leakage correction, and the `k` problem

Blue Bayer pixels also pick up NIR. `compute_bndvi` has an opt-in mode that
estimates visible blue as `max(ε, B − k·R)` before the index.

`DEFAULT_NIR_LEAK_COEF` is **0.35**. It used to be 0.8, which **is** Ned
Horning's — the hard-coded default in Public Lab's PhotoMonitoringPlugin — but
that figure is for a MidOpt DB660/850 narrowband *red* filter with the channels
reversed, justified by red and blue pixels having similar NIR sensitivity at
850 nm. The Rosco #2007 passes NIR broadly from ~695 nm, where Horning himself
notes red pixels are much more NIR-sensitive, so 0.8 is far too high here.
Do not describe 0.8 as a value for this rig (`RESEARCH-GAPS.md` §2).

0.35 is not a measured value either — it matches `SYNTH_LEAK`, the dev-mode
simulation constant. It is a defensible placeholder, not a calibration.

The right answer is to measure it. A white reference must read BNDVI ≈ 0, so
`R = B − k·R` gives **`k = B/R − 1`** — implemented as `bndvi.solve_leak_coef()`
and wired to a drag-a-box gesture in the Debug view. Dev mode's synthetic frames
include a simulated white card and model leakage at `SYNTH_LEAK = 0.35`, so the
whole calibration flow is exercisable with no camera.

## Architecture

Flask + plain Jinja + vanilla JS. **No build step, no frontend framework, no
database.** Django was considered and rejected: an ORM, migrations and an admin
panel buy nothing for one user and a flat list of flights, and cost roughly twice
the memory on a Pi 4.

### Backend modules (`hylocropter/`)

- **`bndvi.py`** — index maths + camera capture, also a CLI. **Must stay
  standalone**: `python bndvi.py --dev` has to work with Flask absent. This is
  the project's minimal reproducer.
- **`camera.py`** — the *single owner* of the camera. One lock arbitrates the
  preview loop and full captures; picamera2 does not tolerate concurrent callers.
  A capture pauses the preview and resumes it afterwards.
- **`telemetry.py`** — pymavlink reader thread. **Read-only: it never arms the
  aircraft.** ⚠️ Has never run against real hardware — see `RESEARCH-GAPS.md` §7.
- **`flights.py`** — flight/capture store, map-grid binning, legacy migration.
- **`settings.py`** — persisted settings with clamping and validation.
- **`system.py`** — device actions. Destructive ones return a confirmation
  contract instead of acting; the route requires an explicit `confirm: true`.
- **`tiles.py`** — offline basemap prefetch, coverage reporting, fallback tile.
- **`applog.py`** — logging to a rotating file plus an in-memory ring the UI reads.
- **`app.py`** — routes only. Keep it thin.

Frontend modules worth knowing: **`static/js/feed.js`** is the shared live-feed
engine (fetch, BNDVI, canvas painting, the drag-a-box region picker) used by both
the Debug view and the setup wizard — don't duplicate it into a third place.
**`templates/setup.html`** + **`static/js/setup.js`** are the guided calibration
walkthrough; each step measures a verdict off the live feed rather than asking the
operator to judge it, which is the whole reason it exists.

### The live debug feed

The server sends **raw NIR, green and blue channel planes** (160×120, binary) from
`GET /api/preview/frame`. The browser derives BNDVI and paints all seven canvases.

Green is sent even though the index ignores it: the channel-split panel claims to
show a measured channel and must actually do so (it used to synthesise green from
the other two, which was a lie), and `filter_sanity()` uses it to detect a gel
that has fallen out of the lens cap.

This is deliberate and worth preserving: the `k`, threshold and correction
controls respond with **zero server round-trips**, and the four renders cannot
drift out of sync because they all come from one array. The Pi's per-frame work is
grab → downsample → send. It reuses the `lores` stream `capture_image()` always
configured and never read.

### Data model

Capture records keep all 8 original keys (`id`, `timestamp`, `label`, `notes`,
`files`, `stats`, `classification`, `settings`) so pre-Hylocropter records still
render. Additions are **additive**: `flight_id`, `geo`, `trigger`, `channels`,
`exposure_check`, `process_ms`, and new keys inside `settings`. Legacy records
have `flight_id: None` and show as "Ground captures".

Flights carry `bounds`, a `grid` (14×9 cells binned from capture positions), and
their own `thresholds`. **Empty grid cells stay `null`** and render transparent —
painting an unvisited cell mid-range would invent healthy ground the drone never
flew over, which is exactly the sort of thing a farmer would act on.

### Three areas, and don't conflate them

This tripped up an earlier pass, so it's worth stating plainly:

| | Setting | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| **Vicinity** | `plot_lat` / `plot_lon` / `plot_box_m` | The one box of satellite imagery downloaded to disk. 620 m, ~55 ha. Ground to *search*, because the farm's exact position is unknown (`RESEARCH-GAPS.md` §9). The `plot_` names are historical — don't call it the plot in the UI. |
| **Survey blocks** | `survey_blocks` | A **list** of named rectangles inside that vicinity — the plots actually flown. `{id, name, south, west, north, east}`. Empty until someone draws one; never defaulted, because a made-up rectangle plans a mission over the wrong ground. |
| **Flight bounds** | `flight.bounds` | Where the drone actually went, derived from the captures' GPS after the fact. |

Rectangles rather than a centre and a side length because real plots aren't square,
and a list because a farm has several. `flights.normalise_block()` is the only
gate: it sorts corners (clicks arrive in any order), rejects anything under 5 m,
and names unnamed blocks. Settings runs values from disk through it too, so a
hand-edited `settings.json` can't reach the map.

`config.block_names()` is **derived** from `survey_blocks`, falling back to the
legacy `blocks` name list when nothing is drawn. That's what the All-flights filter
and the default flight name read, so naming a block on the map is the only place
names are managed — there used to be two lists and they drifted.

`mission_plan()` takes `plot_w_m` / `plot_h_m` (or `plot_side_m` as a square
shorthand) and **runs flight lines along the longer axis** — turns cost battery,
so a 200×60 m strip is 6 lines rather than 20.

**Planning is location-free on purpose.** `/plan` is the planner on its own, for
working numbers out before anyone goes to the farm, so it must keep working with no
blocks, no camera, no drone and no tiles — it is trigonometry. `flights.TEST_AREAS`
are size-only practice areas (basketball court → one hectare) with no coordinates,
because the point is that they are wherever you happen to be and the imagery only
covers Tanauan. Every one of them is small enough to fly on one battery at 12 m,
which `test_mapping.py` pins.

The planner card lives in **`templates/_partials/planner.html`** with its JS in
**`static/js/planner.js`**, shared by `/plan` and `/new-flight` — don't copy it
into a third place. `/api/mission/plan?block=<id>` resolves either a drawn block or
a practice area; explicit `plot_w`/`plot_h` is what the sliders send while you are
still dragging.

### Storage

JSON files, no database. Two fixes from the old version worth keeping: all index
mutation happens under one lock (the old code released the capture lock *before*
the read-append-write, so overlapping requests could lose a record), and writes
are temp-file + `os.replace()` — a power cut mid-write on a drone must not
truncate the index.

## Conventions

- **No backwards-compat with the deleted `ndvi_capture.py`.** It had the bug;
  don't re-add it or re-introduce its naming.
- **Keep `bndvi.py` runnable standalone.**
- **Settings recorded with each capture.** New capture options go in the
  `settings` dict and get rendered on the detail page, so old captures stay
  self-describing. Thresholds are per-capture for the same reason — changing them
  later must not rewrite what was measured.
- **Dev mode is first-class.** Synthetic frames flow through the exact same
  pipeline as real ones; don't branch around `render_outputs` or stats.
- **One colormap.** `BNDVI_COLOR_STOPS` in `bndvi.py` is the source of truth,
  mirrored in `static/js/colormap.js` and handed to matplotlib. There used to be
  three different mappings for the same data — don't add a fourth.
- **Nothing may reach the network at run time.** Leaflet and the fonts are
  vendored; tiles come off local disk. This is the thesis's central claim. If you
  add an asset, vendor it, and re-check with devtools.
- **`[hidden]` is load-bearing.** Every filter and toggle hides things with the
  `hidden` attribute, and component classes set `display`, which beats the UA
  rule. `tokens.css` has `[hidden] { display: none !important }` for this — don't
  remove it.
- **Every failure state must be visible in the UI.** No camera, no drone, no
  tiles, no GPS — each has a designed state saying what's wrong and what to do.
  The user's requirement is that they never need a terminal, so a silent failure
  is a bug.
- **UAV future-proofing.** When asked about extensions, default to additions that
  work for both ground and UAV (geotag fields, not a Pi-only stat).

## Things that are known-unfinished

Read `RESEARCH-GAPS.md` before assuming a number is meaningful. Briefly: the
default `k = 0.35` is a placeholder rather than a measured value; the BNDVI
thresholds are generic rather than dragon-fruit values; the MAVLink path has
never seen real hardware; and the thesis contradicts itself on in-flight vs
post-flight processing (this implementation captures in flight and processes
after landing).

`static/tiles/` is **no longer empty** — 306 tiles at zoom 16–19 (4.8 MB) are
committed, covering the default vicinity box. Settings reports exactly how far
coverage extends, so check there rather than assuming.
