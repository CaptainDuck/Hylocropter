# Deploying Hylocropter on the Pi

The dashboard must work with no internet — that is the argument of the paper, so
nothing in the page may reach the network at run time.

Most of that is already done. This file covers what's left: the basemap, the
Wi-Fi hotspot, the two privileged actions, running it as a service, and the
bench checklist for the parts that could not be tested without hardware.

## What's already offline

| Asset | Where it lives |
|---|---|
| Leaflet 1.9.4 (js, css, marker images) | `hylocropter/static/vendor/leaflet/` |
| Caprasimo + Figtree | `hylocropter/static/fonts/` with local `@font-face` |
| Charts | none — the trend is flexbox, the histogram is a canvas. Chart.js is gone |
| Basemap tiles | `hylocropter/static/tiles/` — **you download these once, see below** |

To prove it: load the dashboard, open devtools → Network, and confirm every
request goes to the Pi. The development check asserted zero external requests
across all seven views; if you add anything, re-check.

## 1. Download the basemap

Do this once, on the Pi or a laptop **with internet**:

1. Open **Settings → Offline map**.
2. Set the plot centre. It defaults to 14.1265 N, 121.0768 E (Brgy. Altura Bata,
   Tanauan City). Better: stand in the field and read the coordinates off a
   phone, then type them in.
3. Pick the box size. 620 m covers 38 ha, which is comfortable around a 5–10 ha
   plot and leaves context when the drone drifts past the boundary.
4. Check the estimate — it shows tiles and megabytes before starting.
5. Click **Download the map**.

Sizes at zoom 16–19 for this latitude:

| Box | Area | Tiles | On disk |
|---|---|---|---|
| 320 m | 10.2 ha | 51 | ~0.9 MB |
| 620 m | 38.4 ha | 138 | ~2.4 MB |
| 1 km | 100 ha | 267 | ~4.7 MB |

Esri World Imagery runs out of detail around zoom 19 (≈29 cm/pixel), so asking
for more just downloads upscaled tiles.

Commit `static/tiles/` afterwards — a few megabytes is worth never thinking
about it again. **Settings** then reports exactly how far coverage extends, and
the farm map draws a dashed boundary at its edge so a flight track running past
it is obvious rather than looking like bare ground.

Missing tiles serve a plain sand-coloured image, never a 404 — Leaflet would
otherwise cover the map in broken-image icons, which reads as a broken dashboard.

> The earlier version of this file suggested copying Mission Planner's prefetched
> cache. **Don't** — it stores tiles in a proprietary `gmapcache/TileDBv3`
> database, not a `{z}/{x}/{y}` tree. The built-in downloader is simpler.

## 2. Camera triggering belongs in the mission

Put `DO_SET_CAM_TRIGG_DIST` in the Mission Planner mission, or set the
`CAM_TRIGG_DIST` parameter. The flight controller then emits `CAMERA_TRIGGER` /
`CAMERA_FEEDBACK` over MAVLink and the Pi captures on each message, with the
controller's own GPS position attached to every photo — which is what places it
correctly on the map.

**The dashboard never arms the aircraft.** Mission Planner flies it; the Pi runs
the camera and the processing. `telemetry.py` only ever reads and requests data
streams; keep it that way.

## 3. Wi-Fi access point

Bookworm uses NetworkManager, so the hotspot is `nmcli`, not `hostapd`:

```bash
sudo nmcli con add type wifi ifname wlan0 mode ap con-name hylocropter \
     ssid Hylocropter autoconnect yes
sudo nmcli con modify hylocropter 802-11-wireless.mode ap \
     802-11-wireless.band bg ipv4.method shared
sudo nmcli con modify hylocropter wifi-sec.key-mgmt wpa-psk
sudo nmcli con modify hylocropter wifi-sec.psk "your-password-here"
sudo nmcli con up hylocropter
```

NetworkManager handles DHCP itself. Set the hostname so `hylocropter.local`
resolves over mDNS:

```bash
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname hylocropter
sudo apt install -y avahi-daemon
```

The dashboard is then at `http://hylocropter.local:5000/` from any phone on the
hotspot.

> Deliberately **not** exposed in the UI: changing the Pi's network config from a
> web page served over that same network is a good way to lock yourself out in a
> field.

### Wi-Fi you can fix from a Mac, and a fallback hotspot

On 2026-10-06 the Pi's only saved network turned out to be a **0-byte file**. The
battery was pulled shortly after the profile was rewritten, so ext4 never wrote
its contents. With no saved network and no monitor at the farm, the only way back
was the SD card. `hylocropter/deploy/` exists so that never happens again:

```bash
sudo sh hylocropter/deploy/install-wifi.sh     # once, on the Pi
```

- **`/boot/firmware/hylocropter-wifi.txt`** lists the networks to join as
  `ssid=` / `password=` pairs. It lives on the FAT boot partition, so any
  computer can edit it: put the card in the Mac, open `bootfs`, change the file,
  then eject. Save it as **plain text**; TextEdit's rich text is refused. The
  installer seeds it from whatever network the Pi is on.
- **`hylocropter-wifi.service`** runs *before* NetworkManager on every boot. It
  turns that file into `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/hylocropter-wifi-*`
  using fsync + rename, so a profile emptied by a power cut is rewritten on the
  next boot. It only touches its own files; networks joined from the desktop stay
  untouched.
- **`hylocropter-wifi-fallback.service`** watches `wlan0`. After
  `hotspot_after` seconds (default 60) with no connection, it brings up an
  **open** network called **Hylocropter**. Join it and open
  `http://10.42.0.1:5000/`; SSH works on that address too. It stays on until the
  next reboot, so whoever just joined is not kicked off. To use the phone hotspot
  again, turn it on and reboot the Pi.

The hotspot is open by choice: a password could not be recovered at the farm
either. SSH still needs the key or the login password. To give the hotspot a
password, set `hotspot_password=` (8+ characters).

Logs are in `journalctl -u hylocropter-wifi -u hylocropter-wifi-fallback`.

**Still shut down before unplugging** (`sudo poweroff`, or the dashboard's Shut
down). This makes a wiped profile recoverable; it does not make power cuts safe
for everything else on the card.

## 4. The two privileged actions

"Shut down the Pi" and "Copy all flights to a USB stick" need more than the app
user has. Rather than running the whole dashboard as root — it serves a web page
to a field Wi-Fi network — grant just those:

```bash
sudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/hylocropter
```

```
pi ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl poweroff
```

Without this, "Shut down the Pi" reports that it isn't allowed rather than
failing silently. USB copy works without sudo as long as the stick is
auto-mounted under `/media`.

## 5. Run it as a service

```bash
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/hylocropter.service >/dev/null <<'EOF'
[Unit]
Description=Hylocropter BNDVI dashboard
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=pi
WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/Hylocropter
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 hylocropter/app.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
sudo systemctl enable --now hylocropter
```

Logs go to `hylocropter/hylocropter_data/hylocropter.log` (rotating, 5 × 1 MB)
as well as journald — and to the **Debug** page's log viewer, which is the point:
you shouldn't need `journalctl` to find out what happened.

## Bench checklist

Everything below could **not** be tested during development — there was no
camera, no flight controller, and no tile access. Work through it before the
demo.

### Camera

- [ ] `python bndvi.py` succeeds and writes to `hylocropter_data/ground/`
- [ ] The raw JPEG shows **pink/magenta vegetation**. If it looks like a normal
      photo, the gel has fallen out or AWB is still on.
- [ ] No red bleed at the frame corners (gel too small)
- [ ] Open **Debug** — all seven canvases paint, and the Red channel is clearly
      brighter than Blue over plants
- [ ] **Verify the AWB/AE lock actually holds.** Point at a fixed scene, then
      shade the subject with your hand. The histogram should shift bodily
      brighter/darker while the **BNDVI mean barely moves**. If the raw
      brightness doesn't change either, the lock failed silently. The dashboard
      also checks every frame against the camera's own metadata and will say so —
      see RESEARCH-GAPS.md §4.
- [ ] **Confirm the ISP is neutralised.** Take a capture and check its detail page
      says "ISP neutralised: yes" with no control-mismatch warning. This matters
      more than it sounds: with the pipeline live, the colour-correction matrix
      mixes green into both red and blue and produces a misclassification band
      right at the 0.3 threshold — and a white card cannot detect it. This code
      path has never run against a camera, so treat it as unverified until you've
      checked. RESEARCH-GAPS.md §4.
- [ ] Put a white card in frame, drag a box over it in Debug, hit **Solve k**.
      Confirm the card then reads BNDVI ≈ 0.
- [ ] A known-healthy plant reads mean BNDVI **+0.3 to +0.7**. A negative value
      means the channel mapping got reversed.

### Flight controller

Test against **ArduPilot SITL over UDP first** — no hardware, no risk:

- [ ] Run SITL on a laptop, set **Settings → MAVLink connection** to
      `udp:127.0.0.1:14550`
- [ ] Header chip goes green; the pre-flight checklist's MAVLink and GPS rows pass
- [ ] Flight mode, waypoint, altitude and GPS populate on the New flight page
- [ ] Arming opens a flight; disarming closes it and lands on Processing
- [ ] `CAM_TRIGG_DIST` fires captures, and each one has a GPS position on its
      detail page

Then the real Pixhawk on `/dev/ttyAMA0` at 57600. Enable the UART and free the
serial console first:

```bash
sudo raspi-config    # Interface Options -> Serial Port -> login shell NO, hardware YES
```

Expect one round of fixes here — message field names and integer scaling
(lat/lon are 1e7-scaled, altitudes are millimetres) are the usual culprits, and
none of this decoding has run against a real stream.

### Which way is the camera turned?

The map turns every photo by the drone's heading **plus** how the camera is turned
on the frame (Settings → *Top of photo points*). Get it wrong and every photo on the
map is rotated or upside down, the seamlines trim the wrong parts, and the planner's
trigger distance and line spacing are swapped. It depends only on how the camera is
mounted, so check it once, and again whenever the mount changes:

- [ ] Draw a big arrow on a sheet of paper, with an **R** beside it. Lay it on the
      floor pointing the way the drone's nose points.
- [ ] Hold the drone level about a metre above it and open **Debug**.
- [ ] Whichever way the arrow points in the picture sets the value: **up → Forward
      (0°)**, **right → Left (270°)**, **down → Backward (180°)**, **left → Right (90°)**.
- [ ] The **R** must read normally. If it is back to front, the image is mirrored,
      which a turn cannot fix; that means a flip in the camera configuration, so
      report it rather than picking a rotation.

Each photo records the value in force when it was taken, so fixing it later does not
turn old flights. Photos taken before it was recorded (before 28 Sep) follow the
current setting.

### Rehearsal, before anyone drives to Tanauan

Do this at school. It costs one battery and catches the failure that would
otherwise waste a farm trip.

- [ ] Open **Plan a flight**, pick *Football field* (or whatever you can walk),
      set the altitude you intend to use at the farm, and note the predicted
      **photo count** and **CAM_TRIGG_DIST**
- [ ] Build that survey grid in Mission Planner with those two numbers
- [ ] Fly it. Then **count the photos the Pi actually saved** and compare
- [ ] Same count → the trigger path works end to end, which is the one thing CI
      cannot prove. Different count → fix it here, not in Tanauan

A count that is far too low usually means `DO_SET_CAM_TRIGG_DIST` never made it
into the mission; far too high usually means an interval trigger is also running.
Both are five-minute fixes on a bench and a ruined afternoon in a field.

### Offline

- [ ] Download the basemap with internet, then **disconnect it**
      (`sudo ip link set wlan0 down` after connecting a laptop to the hotspot) and
      reload every page
- [ ] Map renders, fonts are correct, no broken images, no blank panels
- [ ] Devtools → Network shows nothing leaving the Pi

Anything that silently degrades is a finding for the defense, so fix it now
rather than during.

### Development checks

**The test suite runs anywhere, including on the Pi:**

```bash
pip install -r hylocropter/requirements-dev.txt
pytest
```

325 tests covering the index maths, the photo→footprint→grid mapping chain, the
survey blocks, the JSON store, the settings, and every route rendering with no
camera and no drone.
`.github/workflows/verify.yml` runs the same suite on every push, in one job,
plus the standalone-`bndvi.py` check, the app boot, and greps for a CDN reference
or a reintroduced `(B − R)/(B + R)`.

Worth being explicit: **CI does not test the camera or MAVLink.** Nothing about a
green tick means those work — the checklists above are still the only evidence.

**Playwright** verification lives outside the repo (it needs a browser the Pi
doesn't have). It asserts, for all seven views at desktop and phone widths: the
page renders, Leaflet initialises from the vendored file, the BNDVI overlay
draws, all seven debug canvases actually paint, moving `k` repaints with **zero**
network requests, the threshold sliders move the band percentages, the
white-card solver returns a coefficient, history search hides rows, the battery
chip stays hidden with no telemetry, a blocked tile download reports a clear
reason, and **no request leaves the device**. 42 checks, all passing at the time
of writing.
