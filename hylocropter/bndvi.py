BNDVI Capture & Analysis  —  Hylocropter
=========================================
Hardware : Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (ground rig, or F450 payload)
Camera   : Pi NoIR Camera v2 + bundled blue filter (Rosco Roscolux #2007)

How it works
-------------
The Rosco #2007 blue filter, from Rosco's own Cinegel data sheet (10% overall
transmission, -3.3 stops):
  - PASSES visible blue -- peaks at 53% across 420-440 nm
  - BLOCKS red          -- bottoms out at 2% across 640-660 nm
  - PASSES NIR          -- climbs from 4% at 680 nm to 15% at 700, 42% at 720,
                           67% at 740, and is still rising where the sheet ends
  - LEAKS green         -- 8-18% between 500 and 560 nm, so "blocked" is an
                           approximation, not a fact

Behind the NoIR sensor (no IR-cut filter) the Bayer pattern then sees:
  - Red  Bayer pixels: NIR only            -> Red channel  ~ NIR
  - Blue Bayer pixels: visible blue + NIR  -> Blue channel ~ visible blue
  - Green Bayer pixels: mostly blocked     -> unused by the index

Note the sheet stops at 740 nm, so it does not characterise the 750-900 nm range
where the silicon actually collects most of its NIR. That is why the leakage
coefficient k has to be measured rather than derived -- see below.

So:
    BNDVI = (NIR - Blue) / (NIR + Blue)
          = (R   - B   ) / (R   + B   )

BNDVI ranges -1 to +1. Default class boundaries (see THRESHOLD note below):
    > 0.3   : Dense / healthy vegetation   (rendered green)
    0.1-0.3 : Sparse / moderate vegetation (rendered yellow)
    < 0.1   : Bare soil, water, stress     (rendered red)

Sanity check: pointing at healthy green vegetation should produce a
PINK / MAGENTA raw image (plants reflect a lot of NIR, which lands in
the red channel). If it looks natural-coloured, AWB is still on.

THRESHOLD note
---------------
The defaults above are generic vegetation values, NOT values derived for
dragon fruit (Hylocereus). They are overridable everywhere -- the dashboard
stores them per capture so old records keep their original meaning. See
RESEARCH-GAPS.md section 5 for how to derive real ones from ground truth.

CLI usage
----------
    python bndvi.py                       # capture + analyse + save
    python bndvi.py --dev                 # synthetic test image (laptop dev)
    python bndvi.py --dev --scene soil    # pick a synthetic scene
    python bndvi.py --correct-nir --k 0.8
    python bndvi.py --save-array          # also write the float32 BNDVI as .npz

This module deliberately has NO Flask dependency -- `python bndvi.py --dev`
is the project's minimal reproducer and must always work standalone.

# Below this sum of NIR + visible blue, BNDVI stops measuring reflectance and
# starts measuring the gap between two black levels. Because the NIR (red) Bayer
# channel sits higher than blue at the noise floor -- more dark current, and the
# gel passes NIR broadly while blocking nearly all visible blue -- that error is
# systematically *positive*. An unlit frame therefore reads a confident "healthy"
# rather than obviously broken, which is the dangerous direction: it is exactly
# the reading a farmer would act on.
#
# 20 (out of a 0-510 possible sum) is deliberately conservative -- it catches
# pixels on the noise floor and little else. It is a judgement call, not a
# sourced constant: operational remote sensing prevents this condition with
# radiometric calibration and shadow masking rather than flooring the ratio, and
# the literature warns that fixed thresholds are dataset-dependent. Hence the
# setting, and RESEARCH-GAPS.md section 11.
DEFAULT_MIN_SIGNAL = 20

# NIR-leakage correction: blue Bayer pixels also pick up some NIR. We
# approximate visible_blue as max(eps, B - k*R) where k is the NIR
# responsivity ratio of the blue vs red Bayer pixels.
#
# The B - k*R form is Ned Horning's, from the Public Lab PhotoMonitoringPlugin
# ("subtract a percentage of the NIR pixel values from the visible pixel
# values"), and 0.8 is that plugin's hard-coded default (percentToSubtract=80.0).
#
# BUT 0.8 IS NOT A VALUE FOR THIS RIG. Horning's 80% is for a MidOpt DB660/850
# narrowband red/NIR filter, with the channels the other way round, and he
# justifies it by that filter "centering the NIR band at 850nm where the
# sensitivity of the red detectors is roughly the same as the blue detectors".
# The Rosco #2007 passes a *broad* NIR band from ~695nm, and Horning notes that
# in exactly that case "the red detectors in the camera sensor are much more
# sensitive to the shorter NIR wavelengths" -- so k here should be well below
# 0.8. Measure your own: solve_leak_coef() does it from a white reference in one
# step, and the Debug view wires it to a drag-a-box gesture.
# See RESEARCH-GAPS.md section 2.
#
# So the default is NOT 0.8. It is not a measured figure either -- nobody has
# characterised the #2007 against an IMX219 at these wavelengths, and this rig's
# own value is still unmeasured. 0.35 is where RESEARCH-GAPS.md section 2 lands
# as "a more plausible neighbourhood", and it is the same number the synthetic
# scenes model (SYNTH_LEAK), which keeps the two consistent. It is a placeholder
# with the right order of magnitude, not an answer.
#
# It matters mostly as a starting position, because correct_nir_leakage is off by
# default. When it is switched on, k is savage: on a frame reading NIR 71 /
# blue 29, k = 0.35 gives BNDVI +0.89 and anything above 0.5 pins it at +0.97.
# An over-large k makes everything read healthy, which is the direction that gets
# a farmer to do nothing about a sick field. Measure it before trusting it.

      contains optical brighteners that specifically lift *blue* reflectance --

    * With one target you cannot separate gain from offset, so this k absorbs any
      per-channel gain asymmetry along with the physical leakage. It is a
      rig-and-settings fudge factor that makes your own numbers self-consistent,
      not a physical responsivity ratio.
    * Public Lab's actual procedure is a linear regression of reflectance on
