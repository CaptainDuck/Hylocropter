"""
Single owner of the camera.

Two jobs:

1. Serialise access. picamera2 does not tolerate concurrent callers, and a
   live preview plus a full-resolution capture are exactly that. One lock
   arbitrates both; a capture pauses the preview and resumes it afterwards.

2. Feed the Debug view. Rather than encoding four JPEG streams on the Pi, the
   preview sends the browser small NIR, green and blue channel planes and lets
   JS derive BNDVI and paint all seven canvases.

   Green is sent even though the index ignores it, for two reasons: the channel
   split panel claims to show a measured channel and should actually do so, and
   the setup wizard uses green to work out whether the blue gel is fitted at all
   (without it, green dominates on foliage; with it, green is suppressed). That means the k slider,
   the threshold sliders and the correction toggle respond with no server
   round-trip at all, and the four renders cannot drift out of sync because
   they all come from one array. The Pi's only job per frame is grab →
   downsample → send.

The preview runs its own 640x480 RGB888 `main` stream and downsamples from it.
It deliberately does not use a `lores` stream: on the Pi 4's VC4 pipeline lores
must be YUV420, and converting that back to RGB would run the very colour matrix
that `neutralise_isp` exists to switch off -- green would bleed into both the NIR
and the blue plane, which is precisely the measurement this view has to protect.
